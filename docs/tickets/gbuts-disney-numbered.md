# Disney numbered listing

- [x] Inspect existing inventory, listing, order, private chat and public access flows.
- [x] Add dedicated numbered Disney delivery and password-only buyer views.
- [x] Verify allocation/restart/refund/isolation, delivery idempotency, API persistence and both renderers; build and review.
- [ ] Commit, push, deploy local source and verify production.
- [ ] Register the requested account and publish one real six-place listing; verify seller page.

Pre-deploy: 109 targeted tests pass across ten suites; client build passes. Server type check retains existing diagnostics in chat/finance/Spotify modules and API index, with none in the changed modules. Self-review checked stable/refund/missing leases, legacy flow preservation, mailbox suppression in both renderers, no credentials in public copy, existing admin authentication, and no extra React effects or data fetches.
